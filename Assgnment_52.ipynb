        "Lasso regression differs from other regression techniques such as ridge regression and ordinary least squares regression (OLS) in its penalty term. While ridge regression uses the square of the coefficients as the penalty term (L2 regularization), and OLS has no penalty term, lasso regression uses the absolute value of the coefficients as the penalty term.\n",

        "This difference leads to some unique properties of lasso regression, such as the ability to perform variable selection and feature reduction. The penalty term in lasso regression encourages some of the coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively removing the corresponding features from the model.\n",

        "Lasso regression is often used in high-dimensional data analysis and can be particularly useful when there are many features but only a subset of them are relevant for the outcome. However, lasso regression can be sensitive to correlated features and may not perform well when there are strong correlations between the predictors."

There are several ways to specify the regularization parameter in Lasso Regression:\n",

First, they control the bias-variance trade-off of the model, which determines the balance between the model's ability to fit the training data well and its ability to generalize to new data. A higher value of alpha or lambda increases the regularization strength, which reduces the variance of the model but increases its bias. Conversely, a lower value of alpha or lambda decreases the regularization strength, which increases the variance of the model but decreases its bias.\n",

A higher value of alpha or lambda leads to a sparser model with fewer non-zero coefficients, while a lower value of alpha or lambda leads to a denser model with more non-zero coefficients. The choice of tuning parameters depends on the specific problem and the trade-off between model complexity and performance."
