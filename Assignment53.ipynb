        "ans 1:Elastic Net Regression is a type of regularized regression method that combines the strengths of two popular techniques: Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "Like Lasso regression, Elastic Net can perform variable selection by shrinking some of the coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating some features from the model. However, Elastic Net can also handle the multicollinearity problem, which occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, by using the Ridge regression penalty.\n",
        "\n",
        "Elastic Net regression uses a penalty term that is a combination of both L1 and L2 penalties. The strength of each penalty is determined by a hyperparameter called alpha, which controls the trade-off between the two penalties.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to other regression techniques, Elastic Net regression can provide better prediction accuracy when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with many correlated predictors. It can also handle cases where there are more predictors than observations, a situation known as the \"p > n\" problem, which can cause issues for other regression methods."

        "\n",
        "Alpha: Determines the mix of L1 and L2 regularization in Elastic Net Regression. Alpha ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is equivalent to Ridge regression and 1 is equivalent to Lasso regression. Generally, a grid search or randomized search can be used to find the optimal value of alpha by testing a range of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lambda: Determines the strength of the regularization. A higher lambda value will result in stronger regularization and smaller coefficients. Cross-validation can be used to select the optimal value of lambda by testing a range of values and selecting the value that gives the best performance on a validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "One common approach to tuning the hyperparameters is to use nested cross-validation. The outer loop performs k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance using different hyperparameter values. The inner loop performs k-fold cross-validation on the training set to select the optimal hyperparameters. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.\n",

        "Another approach is to use a method such as Bayesian Optimization to search for the optimal hyperparameters. Bayesian Optimization uses a probabilistic model to predict the performance of different hyperparameter combinations and selects the combination that is expected to perform the best.\n",
