The scaling process involves subtracting the minimum value of a feature from each value and dividing by the range of the feature (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). The resulting values are between 0 and 1, with the minimum value of the feature scaled to 0 and the maximum value scaled to 1.\n",
