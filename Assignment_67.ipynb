When an individual tree overfits the training data, it may capture noise or idiosyncrasies in the data that are not generalizable to new data. By using an ensemble of trees that are trained on different subsets of the data, these idiosyncrasies are less likely to be present in all the trees, and thus will not be amplified in the final prediction."

With a smaller ensemble size, the model may have higher bias and lower variance, while with a larger ensemble size, the model may have lower bias and higher variance. This is because a larger ensemble size tends to reduce the variance of the model, but may also increase the bias by averaging out the individual models.\n",
