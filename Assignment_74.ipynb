        "ans 1: The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN is the way they calculate the distance between two data points. The Euclidean distance metric calculates the distance between two points as the length of a straight line between them, while the Manhattan distance metric calculates the distance as the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of the two points.\n",

In general, the Euclidean distance metric is more sensitive to differences in the magnitude of the data features, while the Manhattan distance metric is more robust to differences in scale and orientation.\n",

In general, a larger training set can lead to better performance by providing more representative examples of the underlying data distribution and reducing the impact of sampling noise.
