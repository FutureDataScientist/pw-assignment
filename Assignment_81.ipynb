        "Ans 1: Hierarchical clustering is a clustering algorithm that groups similar objects into clusters based on their similarity or distance. It creates a tree-like hierarchy of clusters, also known as a dendrogram, where the root node represents the entire dataset, and the leaf nodes represent individual data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hierarchical clustering is different from other clustering techniques in that it does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance, unlike k-means clustering, for example. Instead, hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of nested clusters that can be visualized using a dendrogram. It can also handle datasets with complex structures, such as non-convex shapes, and can reveal insights about the underlying data structure that may not be immediately apparent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important difference is that hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative or divisive, meaning it can either start with each data point as a separate cluster and gradually merge them into larger clusters (agglomerative) or start with the entire dataset as a single cluster and recursively divide it into smaller clusters (divisive). In contrast, other clustering techniques like k-means are typically agglomerative and do not offer the option to divide clusters once they have been formed."

At each step, it chooses the two closest clusters and merges them based on a linkage criterion, such as single linkage, complete linkage, or average linkage. Single linkage considers the shortest distance between two points in each cluster, complete linkage considers the longest distance between two points in each cluster, and average linkage considers the average distance between all pairs of points in each cluster.\n",

It chooses a cluster to split based on a criterion that maximizes the difference between the subclusters, such as variance or entropy. Divisive clustering can be computationally expensive and may not be practical for large datasets. However, it can be useful for revealing the hierarchical structure of the data and understanding how the different clusters relate to each other."
