    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics are used to describe and summarize data. They provide information about the central tendency, variability, and shape of a data set. Examples of descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, and quartiles.\n",
    "For example, a company may use descriptive statistics to analyze their sales data over the past year to determine the average monthly sales, the range of sales, and the variance of sales. These descriptive statistics can help the company better understand their sales performance and identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. They allow us to draw conclusions about a larger population based on a smaller sample of data. Examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
    "For example, a medical researcher may use inferential statistics to test the effectiveness of a new drug. They may select a sample of patients to receive the drug and another sample to receive a placebo. By analyzing the results of the two groups, the researcher can infer whether the drug is effective for the larger population of patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of statistics are important in different contexts and can be used in conjunction with each other to gain a better understanding of data. Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize and explore data, while inferential statistics can be used to draw conclusions and make predictions about larger populations based on samples of data.\n"

    "ans 6 It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because different statistical techniques are appropriate for different types of data. The level of measurement determines the types of statistical analyses that can be used, the appropriate measures of central tendency and variability, and the types of conclusions that can be drawn from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider the variable \"age\" in a survey of a population. If \"age\" is measured as a nominal variable (e.g., grouped into age ranges), we can only make statements about the frequency or proportion of individuals in each age range, but we cannot calculate the mean or median age of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if \"age\" is measured as a quantitative variable, we can calculate measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and variability (e.g., standard deviation) to describe the distribution of ages in the population. However, if \"age\" is measured as an ordinal variable (e.g., ranked by age groups such as \"young,\" \"middle-aged,\" and \"old\"), we can calculate measures of central tendency, but we cannot assume that the intervals between the age groups are equal.\n",
